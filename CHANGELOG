    * Reverts to using ids over global identifiers for `sl vs list` and `sl server list`.


4.0.0

    * Because there are many changes between version 3 and version 4, it is strongly recommend to pin the version of the SoftLayer python bindings as soon as you can in order to prevent unintentional breakage when upgrading. To keep yourself on version 3, you can use this directive: softlayer>=3,<4. That can be used with pip (pip install softlayer>=3,<4), requirements in your setup.py and/or in your requirements.txt file.

    * CLI: The command is renamed from `sl` to `slcli` to avoid package conflicts.

    * CLI: Global options now need to be specified right after the `slcli` command. For example, you would now use `slcli --format=raw list` over `slcli vs list --format=raw`. This is a change for the following options:
        * --format
        * -c or --config
        * --debug
        * --proxy
        * -y or --really
        * --version

    * API: The hardware manager has a significant update to how place_order() works. It will now only support the fast server provisioning package which has presets for options like CPU, Memory and disk.

    * API: The client transport is now pluggable. If you want to add extra logging or accounting, you can now subclass or wrap softlayer.transports.XmlRpcTransport in order to do so. A good example of that is done with softlayer.transports.TimingTransport.

    * API: Removed deprecated SoftLayer.CCIManager.

    * API: Adds virtual server rescue command to SoftLayer.VSManager

    * API+CLI: Adds ability to import virtual images from a given URI. The API only supports importing from a swift account using 'swift://'. For more details, see http://developer.softlayer.com/reference/services/SoftLayer_Virtual_Guest_Block_Device_Template_Group/createFromExternalSource.

    * CLI: A `--fixtures` global flag was added to pull from fixture data instead of the API. This is useful for discovery, demonstration and testing purposes.

    * CLI: A `--verbose` or `-v` flag was added to eventually replace `--debug`. To make a command more verbose, simply add more `-v` flags. For example `sl -vvv vs list` will be the most verbose and show everything down to request/response tracing.

    * CLI: Significant changes were done to the CLI argument parsing. Docopt was dropped in favor of click. Therefore, some subtle differences which aren't documented here may exist.

    * CLI: Credentials can now be requested using `sl vs credentials <identifier>`, `sl hardware credentials <identifier>` and `sl nas credentials <identifier>` for virtual servers, hardware servers and NAS accounts respectively.

    * CLI: Adds virtual server rescue command, `sl vs rescue <identifier>`
