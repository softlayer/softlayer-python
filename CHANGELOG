3.0.1

    * CLI: Fixed an error message about pricing information that appeared when ordering a new private subnet.

    * CLI+API: Added ability to specify SSH keys when reloading CCIs and servers.

3.0.0

    * Many bug fixes and consistency improvements

    * API: Removes old API client interfaces which have been deprecated in the v2. See link for more details: https://softlayer-api-python-client.readthedocs.org/en/latest/api/client/#backwards-compatibility

    * CLI+API: Improved dedicated server ordering. Adds power management for hardware servers: power-on, power-off, power-cycle, reboot

    * CLI+API: Adds a networking manager and adds several network-related CLI modules. This includes the ability to:

        * list, create, cancel and assign global IPs

        * list, create, cancel and detail subnets. Also has the ability to lookup details about an IP address with 'sl subnet lookup'

        * list, detail VLANs

        * show and edit RWhois data

    * CLI+API: Adds SoftLayer Message Queue Service bindings (as a manager) and a CLI counterpart. With this you can interact with existing message queue accounts

    * CLI+API: Ability to manage SSH Keys with a manager and a CLI module

    * CLI+API: Adds the ability to create CCIs with the following options: metadata, post-install script, SSH key

    * CLI: Adds templating for creating CCIs and hardware nodes which can be used to create more CCIs and hardware with the same settings

    * CLI+API: Adds the ability to create hardware servers with a default SSH key

    * CLI: Adds a --debug option to print out debugging information. --debug=3 is the highest log level which prints full HTTP request/responses including the body

    * CLI: The commands in the main help are now organized into categories


2.3.0

    * Several bug fixes and improvements

    * Removed Python 2.5 support. Some stuff MIGHT work with 2.5 but it is no longer tested

    * API: Refactored managers into their own module to not clutter the top level

    * CLI+API: Added much more hardware support: Filters for hardware listing, dedicated server/bare metal cloud ordering, hardware cancellation

    * CLI+API: Added DNS Zone filtering (server side)

    * CLI+API: Added Post Install script support for CCIs and hardware

    * CLI: Added Message queue functionality

    * CLI: Added --debug option to CLI commands

    * API: Added more logging

    * API: Added token-based auth so you can use the API bindings with your username/password if you want. (It's still highly recommended to use your API key instead of your password)


2.2.0

    * Consistency changes/bug fixes

    * Added sphinx documentation. See it here: https://softlayer-api-python-client.readthedocs.org
 
    * CCI: Adds Support for Additional Disks
 
    * CCI: Adds a way to block until transactions are done on a CCI
 
    * CLI: For most CCI commands, you can specify id, hostname, private ip or public ip as <identifier>
 
    * CLI: Adds the ability to filter list results for CCIs
 
    * API: for large result sets, requests can now be chunked into smaller batches on the server side. Using service.iter_call('getObjects', ...) or service.getObjects(..., iter=True) will return a generator regardless of the results returned. offset and limit can be passed in like normal. An additional named parameter of 'chunk' is used to limit the number of items coming back in a single request, defaults to 100
