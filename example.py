# The SoftLayer API client package is here:
import SoftLayer.API

# Used for pretty printing output.
import pprint

# It's possible to define your SoftLayer API username and key directly in the
# package, but it's far easier to define them before creating your API client.
api_username = 'set me'
api_key = 'set me too'

# Usage:
# SoftLayer.API.Client([API Service], <object id>, [username], [API key])
#
# API Service: The name of the API service you wish to connect to.
# id:          An optional id to initialize your API service with, if you're
#              interacting with a specific object. If you don't need to specify
#              an id then pass None to the client.
# username:    Your SoftLayer API username.
# API key:     Your SoftLayer API key,
client = SoftLayer.API.Client('SoftLayer_Account', None, api_username, api_key)

# Once your client object is created you can call API methods for that service
# directly against your client object. A call may throw an exception on error,
# so it's best to try your call and catch exceptions.
#
# This example calls the getObject() method in the SoftLayer_Account API
# service. <http://sldn.softlayer.com/wiki/index.php/SoftLayer_Account::getObject>
# It retrieves basic account information, and is a great way to test your API
# account and connectivity.
#
# If you're using Python 3.x then you'll need to change these except and
# print() statements accordingly.
try:
    pprint.pprint(client.getObject())
except Exception, e:
    print e


# For a more complex example we’ll retrieve a support ticket with id 123456
# along with the ticket’s updates, the user it’s assigned to, the servers
# attached to it, and the datacenter those servers are in. We’ll retrieve our
# extra information using a nested object mask. After we have the ticket we’ll
# update it with the text ‘Hello!’.

# Declare an API client to connect to the SoftLayer_Ticket API service.
client = SoftLayer.API.Client('SoftLayer_Ticket', 123456, api_username, api_key)

# Assign an object mask to our API client:
client.set_object_mask({
    'updates' : {},
    'assignedUser' : {},
    'attachedHardware' : {
        'datacenter' : {}
    },
})

# Retrieve the ticket record.
ticket = None
try:
    ticket = client.getObject()
except Exception, e:
    print "Unable to retrieve ticket record: ", e

# Now update the ticket.
update = {
    'entry' : 'Hello!',
}

try:
    update = client.addUpdate(update)
    print "Update ticket 123456. The new update's id is %s." % update[0]['id']
except Exception, e:
    print "Unable to update ticket: ", e
