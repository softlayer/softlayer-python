**What are you trying to do?**
A brief explanation of what you are trying to do. Could be something simple like `slcli vs list` doesn't support a filter you need. Or more complex like recreating some functionality that exists in the cloud.ibm.com portal

**Screen shots**
If the functionality you want exists in the portal, please add a screenshot so we have a better idea of what you need.

**Additional context**
Add any other context or screenshots about the feature request here.
