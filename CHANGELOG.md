# Change Log

## [Unreleased]
 - Changes: https://github.com/softlayer/softlayer-python/compare/v5.2.1...HEAD

### Added

### Changed

## [5.2.1] - 2016-10-4
 - Changes: https://github.com/softlayer/softlayer-python/compare/v5.2.0...v5.2.1

### Added
 - CLI: Adds a new 'jsonraw' format option that will print JSON without whitespace. This is useful for integrating the CLI with other tooling.

### Changed
 - API: Fixes JSON loading while using the REST transport with Python 3
 - CLI+API: Metadata disks are now excluded when capturing "all" block devices with `slcli virtual capture --all`
 - CLI: Fixes a bug where dns zone importing was not importing wildcard records

## [5.2.0] - 2016-08-25
 - Changes: https://github.com/softlayer/softlayer-python/compare/v5.1.0...v5.2.0

### Added
 - CLI+API: Significant additions to `slcli file` and `slcli block` commands. You can now authorize hosts, revoke access. You can also create, delete, restore, disable, enable snapshots. These features need to be battle-tested so report any issues that you see.
 - CLI+API: Adds logic to `SoftLayer.create_client_from_env` that detects if a REST endpoint_url was given in order to use the REST transport automatically. This means that you can also configure REST endpoints for `slcli`. The default still uses XML-RPC endpoint, but from a small amount of testing shows that the REST transport is significantly faster.
 - CLI: Adds `--network-space` to `slcli subnet list` in order to filter subnets based on network space. The two main options are PUBLIC and PRIVATE. For example, to list all public subnets, you can run: `slcli subnet list --network-space=PUBLIC`
 - CLI: Adds a new, non-default column, "created_by" that shows who ordered the volume for `slcli file volume-list` and `slcli block volume-list`.
 - CLI: Adds a new `slcli report bandwidth` command that will print a report of all bandwidth pools and virtual/hardware servers that your user has access to.
 - CLI: Adds an "IN" syntax to the `slcli call-api` command. For example, to find VSIs that are in either the dal05 or sng01 datacenter you can run this command: `slcli call-api Account getVirtualGuests -f 'virtualGuests.datacenter.name IN dal05,sng01'`

### Changed
 - CLI: Fixes a UnicodeEncodeError when piping slcli output with unicode characters. This was mostly reported with `slcli image list` but could also happen with many other calls.
 - CLI: Fixed a bug where os_version was not displaying correctly in `slcli virtual detail` or `slcli virtual detail`

## [5.1.0] - 2016-05-12
 - Changes: https://github.com/softlayer/softlayer-python/compare/v5.0.1...v5.1.0

### Added
 - CLI+API: Added block storage functionality. You can order, list, detail, cancel volumes. You can list and delete snapshots. You can also list ACLs for volumes.
 - Added functionality to attach/detach devices to tickets
 - CLI: Virtual list now lists users and passwords for all known software

### Changed
 - CLI: Fixes bug with `vlan detail` CLI command

## [5.0.1] - 2016-03-30

### Changed
 - CLI: Move modifying nic speed to `slcli virtual edit` and `slcli hardware edit` instead of having its own command

## [4.0.0] - 2015-04-21
 - Changes: https://github.com/softlayer/softlayer-python/compare/v3.3.0...v4.0.0
 - Because there are many changes between version 3 and version 4, it is strongly recommend to pin the version of the SoftLayer python bindings as soon as you can in order to prevent unintentional breakage when upgrading. To keep yourself on version 3, you can use this directive: softlayer>=3,<4. That can be used with pip (pip install softlayer>=3,<4), requirements in your setup.py and/or in your requirements.txt file.

### Added
 - API: The client transport is now pluggable. If you want to add extra logging or accounting, you can now subclass or wrap softlayer.transports.XmlRpcTransport in order to do so. A good example of that is done with softlayer.transports.TimingTransport.
 - API+CLI: Adds ability to import virtual images from a given URI. The API only supports importing from a swift account using 'swift://'. For more details, see http://developer.softlayer.com/reference/services/SoftLayer_Virtual_Guest_Block_Device_Template_Group/createFromExternalSource.
 - CLI: A `--fixtures` global flag was added to pull from fixture data instead of the API. This is useful for discovery, demonstration and testing purposes.
 - CLI: A `--verbose` or `-v` flag was added to eventually replace `--debug`. To make a command more verbose, simply add more `-v` flags. For example `sl -vvv vs list` will be the most verbose and show everything down to request/response tracing.
 - CLI: Credentials can now be requested using `sl vs credentials <identifier>`, `sl hardware credentials <identifier>` and `sl nas credentials <identifier>` for virtual servers, hardware servers and NAS accounts respectively.
 - CLI: Adds virtual server rescue command, `sl vs rescue <identifier>`

### Changed
 - CLI: The command is renamed from `sl` to `slcli` to avoid package conflicts.
 - CLI: Global options now need to be specified right after the `slcli` command. For example, you would now use `slcli --format=raw list` over `slcli vs list --format=raw`. This is a change for the following options:
   - --format
   - -c or --config
   - --debug
   - --proxy
   - -y or --really
   - --version
 - API: The hardware manager has a significant update to how place_order() works. It will now only support the fast server provisioning package which has presets for options like CPU, Memory and disk.
 - API: Removed deprecated SoftLayer.CCIManager.
 - API: Adds virtual server rescue command to SoftLayer.VSManager
 - CLI: Significant changes were done to the CLI argument parsing. Docopt was dropped in favor of click. Therefore, some subtle differences which aren't documented here may exist.
